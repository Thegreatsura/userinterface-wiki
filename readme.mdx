# A Living Manual for Better Interfaces

I believe knowledge is best when shared. This wiki is a collection of articles, patterns, and best practices for designing and building user interfaces. It's a living manual that evolves with the field, incorporating new insights and techniques as they emerge.

Feel free to explore the articles, contribute your own experiences, and help shape the future of user interface design.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

### Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Build

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Tech Stack

The backbone of this wiki is built with [Fumadocs](https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs), it's a wonderful framework for creating documentation sites using Next.js and MDX. 

Most if not all components are also built with [Base UI](https://base-ui.com/). This in my opinion is the best design system for building modern web applications with React.




## Project Structure

```
app/              # Next.js app router pages
components/       # React components
content/          # MDX articles and demos
icons/            # SVG icon components
lib/              # Utilities, types, and stores
public/           # Static assets (fonts, media)
styles/           # Global CSS
```

## Writing Articles

Articles live in `content/` as MDX files. Each article has its own folder with an `index.mdx` and optional `demos/` folder for interactive examples.

```
content/
  my-article/
    index.mdx
    demos/
      index.ts
      my-demo/
        index.tsx
        styles.module.css
```
